## 👨‍💻 About Me

I'm a Machine Learning Engineer at Afresh, where I focus on building robust, production-grade ML pipelines that deliver real business impact.

My work spans the entire machine learning lifecycle — from **data ingestion and experimentation**, to **model deployment and observability**, always backed by solid MLOps principles. I believe ML is more than just training models — it's about building **systems that learn and last**.

### 🧠 What Drives Me

- I’m **deeply curious** about how machines reason — especially in the context of **language and abstraction**.  
- I’m currently focused on **training small yet capable language models** with a bias toward **reasoning, grounding, and instruction-following**.
- I care about **model efficiency**, **evaluation** beyond benchmarks, and building models that can actually **help people**, not just impress benchmarks.

> 🛠️ "Trying to build something meaningful" isn’t just a phrase — it's the compass that guides every project I take on.
